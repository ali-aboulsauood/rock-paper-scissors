# Rock, Paper, Scissors!

A simple browser game of [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Rock,-Paper,-Scissors), written in JavaScript.

This project was created as the [third practice project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) during my journey with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), the [first](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) and [second](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) being _[Recipes](https://github.com/ali-aboulsauood/odin-recipes)_ and _[Landing Page](https://github.com/ali-aboulsauood/landing-page)_, respectively.

## How to play

1. Go to the [_Rock, Paper, Scissors!_ Live GitHub Page](https://ali-aboulsauood.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/).
2. Play the game by selecting an item (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) on each round.

   You can select an item by:
   <ol type="a">
    <li>clicking its corresponding button using a pointing device (or touching it on a touchscreen)</li>
    <li>
    pressing one of its two corresponding keys on the keyboard:

    - `1` or `R` for **Rock**
    - `2` or `P` for **Paper**
    - `3` or `S` for **Scissors**
    </li>
   </ol>

Rock beats Scissors, which in turn beats Paper, which in turn beats Rock. The player whose item beats that of the other earns one point, while the other's points remain the same.
If you and the computer choose the same item, both scores remain the same.

The game ends once a player has earned **five (5) points**, where that player is declared the winner.

Once the game ends, the Restart button appears. Click the button or press `Enter` to restart the game.
